# challengezedelivery
# Install
1. You will need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to run the database and the app.

2. Build the app image using the following command: 
```
docker build -t challengezedelivery_app:latest ./
```

### (Optional) 
1. If you want to recompile the source code, you will need to install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) on your local machine.
2. Run the command:
```
mvn clean install
```

# Run
1. Open the directory that you have cloned the master branch and run on a new terminal `docker-compose up`.

2. Once the database and the application is up, you can continue and test the application.

# Test suggestion
There's a Postman Collection on the root of the source code named: `challenge-ze-delivery.postman_collection.json`.
On that Collection will have all the three available endpoints.

# Available endpoints

 > ## **GET** /partner/{id}
 > ## **GET** /partner/nearby/{lon}/{lat}
 > ## **POST** /partner
