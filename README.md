# challengezedelivery
#Install
You will need to install [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to run the database and the app.

# Run
Open the directory that you have cloned the master branch, and run on a prompt `docker-compose up`.

Once the database and the application is up, you can continue and test the application.

# Test suggestion
There's a Postman Collection on the root of the source code named: `challenge-ze-delivery.postman_collection.json`.
On that Collection will have all the three available endpoints.

# Available endpoints

> ## **GET** /partner/{id}
> ## **GET** /partner/nearby/{lon}/{lat}

> ## **POST** /partner
